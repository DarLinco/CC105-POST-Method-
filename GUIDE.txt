Requirements:
1. XAMPP software to give our system to work like a localhost.
2. IP address of your Computer. Note: Type ipconfig in command prompt, IPv4 is your PC IP address.
3. Make sure that your project and physical emulator are connected to the similar network.

Steps:
1. Open XAMPP, and start Apache and MySQL services. Now your system is ready to use like a local host computer.
2. Create your database
3. Create PHP Script to convert MySQL DB into JSON(open insert.php) and make sure that it is saved in the following file path:
        C:\xampp\htdocs\[YOUR_FOLDER]\api\insert.php
4. Also store your react project in   C:\xampp\htdocs\[folder where \api\insert.php stored]\[YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER_HERE]
5. In your front end (SignUp.js) is where all the authentications, validations and Fetch API is implemented.
